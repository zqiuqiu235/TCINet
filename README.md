# Three-decoder Cross-modal Interaction Network for Unregistered RGB-T Salient Object Detection

## Overiew
In this paper we present a saliency target detection method for unaligned RGB-T image pairs that achieves competitive performance in a variety of scene-challenging scenarios. In particular, our method achieves the best results in challenging scenes such as occlusion.
